Docstrings are an important way to document code and
make clear to other programmers the intent and meaning
behind what you're writing. We are somewhat different
on the formatting, but we want it to include 1)
Description, 2) Parameters, 3) Returns



```python
def string_find(str1, str2):
""" Returns whether str2 can be found within str1
Parameters:
str1 (str): The haystack
str2 (str): The needle
Returns:
(bool): Whether or not str2 could be found in str1
"""
```
